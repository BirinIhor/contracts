What?
=====

NoneToken is a ERC-20 Token with a totalSupply of 0.
It was mainly created because of an issue with ShapeShift: https://github.com/walleth/walleth/issues/94#issuecomment-398040161

But it can also be useful for testing.
It might discover some division by zero bugs when developers think - totalSupply will never be zero as this makes no sense -  but it is possible.

And last but not least this token is interesting from a philosophical point of view as this token is most rare and most evenly/fairly distributed ;-)
